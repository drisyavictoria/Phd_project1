The repository contains several codes developed for my Phd_work1. The work is basically short-term wind speed forecast using chaotic prediction tools. For analysis, we used 10 min resolution wind speed data measured at 234 different locations of the period from January 2004 to January 2007. The data can be downloaded from National Renewable Energy Laboratory - USA website, http://www.nrel.gov .
The results of this work has been published in Annales Geophysicae, https://www.ann-geophys.net/32/1415/2014/ . A copy of the article is also included in the parent directory.
